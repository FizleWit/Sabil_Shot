A screen Recording and Action Replay Solution


Capstone Project for 2023
 
For my Capstone Project I designed a desktop application for Windows using Tauri.
The app when ran and executed Will let you record files that have
 -Desktop Video
 -Desktop Audio
 -Microphone Audio

To run it you will need a Stero Mix Audio Device (I recommend the Realtek Audio Drivers) and a Microphone ready to go.

The app uses FFMPEG to make the .mp4 files.

To install either clone the repo and build with "cargo tauri build" 
or run the MSI installer attached to the repo.

Thanks for reading.
